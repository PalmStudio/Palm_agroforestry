## Introduction

The aim of this project is to simulate Palm oil trees in agroforestry.
The aim of the first project is to mix *Elaeis guineensis* trees with
upland rice in collaboration with the Brawijaya university in Malang,
Indonesia.

## *E. guineensis* and rice

To simplify the simulations, we only simulate palm trees in the scene,
and compute the light incident on a plane at 1 meter above the ground,
i.e.Â at the height of the fully grown rice plants. More details about
the project can be found in the Palm\_Rice folder.
