## Introduction

The aim of this project is to simulate Palm oil trees in agroforestry.
The aim of the first project is to mix *Elaeis guineensis* trees with upland rice in collaboration with the Brawijaya university in Malang, Indonesia. 

## *E. guineensis* and rice

To simplify the simulations, we only simulate palm trees in the scene, and compute the light incident on a plane at 1 meter above the ground, i.e. at the height of the fully grown rice plants. More details about the project can be found in the Palm_Rice folder.
